# Using Deep Q-Network to Learn How To Play

### Machine Learning Helicopter

## Overview

## Installation Dependencies:
* Python 3
* TensorFlow
* pygame
* OpenCV-Python

I have created a requirements text file to install the modules. However this only works with Python 3, you have to do
extra steps to make it work with Python 2.

## How to Run?
```
git clone git@github.com:SalvadorRamon/HelicopterMachineLearning.git
cd HelicopterMachineLearning
python deep_q_network.py
```

## Deep Q-Network Algorithm

The pseudo-code for the Deep Q Learning algorithm, as given in [1], can be found below:

```
Initialize replay memory D to size N
Initialize action-value function Q with random weights
for episode = 1, M do
    Initialize state s_1
    for t = 1, T do
        With probability ϵ select random action a_t
        otherwise select a_t=max_a  Q(s_t,a; θ_i)
        Execute action a_t in emulator and observe r_t and s_(t+1)
        Store transition (s_t,a_t,r_t,s_(t+1)) in D
        Sample a minibatch of transitions (s_j,a_j,r_j,s_(j+1)) from D
        Set y_j:=
            r_j for terminal s_(j+1)
            r_j+γ*max_(a^' )  Q(s_(j+1),a'; θ_i) for non-terminal s_(j+1)
        Perform a gradient step on (y_j-Q(s_j,a_j; θ_i))^2 with respect to θ
    end for
end for
```

## FAQ

2. Modify `deep_q_network.py`'s parameter as follow:
```python
OBSERVE = 10000
EXPLORE = 3000000
FINAL_EPSILON = 0.0001
INITIAL_EPSILON = 0.1
```
